smolagents provides a flexible framework that allows you to use various language models from different providers. This guide will show you how to use different model types with your agents.

Available model types
smolagents supports several model types out of the box:

InferenceClientModel: Uses Hugging Face’s Inference API to access models
TransformersModel: Runs models locally using the Transformers library
VLLMModel: Uses vLLM for fast inference with optimized serving
MLXModel: Optimized for Apple Silicon devices using MLX
LiteLLMModel: Provides access to hundreds of LLMs through LiteLLM
LiteLLMRouterModel: Distributes requests among multiple models
OpenAIServerModel: Provides access to any provider that implements an OpenAI-compatible API
AzureOpenAIServerModel: Uses Azure’s OpenAI service
AmazonBedrockServerModel: Connects to AWS Bedrock’s API
Using Google Gemini Models
As explained in the Google Gemini API documentation (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai), Google provides an OpenAI-compatible API for Gemini models, allowing you to use the OpenAIServerModel with Gemini models by setting the appropriate base URL.

First, install the required dependencies:

pip install smolagents[openai]

Then, get a Gemini API key and set it in your code:

GEMINI_API_KEY = <YOUR-GEMINI-API-KEY>

Now, you can initialize the Gemini model using the OpenAIServerModel class and setting the api_base parameter to the Gemini API base URL:

from smolagents import OpenAIServerModel

model = OpenAIServerModel(
    model_id="gemini-2.0-flash",
    # Google Gemini OpenAI-compatible API base URL
    api_base="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
    api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY,
)
Using OpenRouter Models
OpenRouter provides access to a wide variety of language models through a unified OpenAI-compatible API. You can use the OpenAIServerModel to connect to OpenRouter by setting the appropriate base URL.

First, install the required dependencies:
pip install smolagents[openai]
Then, get an OpenRouter API key and set it in your code
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = <YOUR-OPENROUTER-API-KEY>

Now, you can initialize any model available on OpenRouter using the OpenAIServerModel class:
from smolagents import OpenAIServerModel

model = OpenAIServerModel(
    # You can use any model ID available on OpenRouter
    model_id="openai/gpt-4o",
    # OpenRouter API base URL
    api_base="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
)
